Sperm Storage Fees (Long Term)
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: The page states that long-term sperm storage is considered an elective, non-treatment expense and therefore does not qualify as a medical expense under HSA/FSA rules.

Sperm Storage Fees (Short Term)
Eligible

Stair Lift
Eligible
Eligible: A stair lift is classified as durable medical equipment that helps individuals with a medical condition or disability safely navigate stairs. Because it is a capital improvement made solely to accommodate or alleviate a medical disability, the expense qualifies for HSA/FSA reimbursement without needing additional documentation.

Standing Desk

Sunburn Creams and Ointments
Eligible
Eligible: Sunburn creams and ointments are over-the-counter medications formulated to relieve pain, redness, and inflammation caused by a sunburn.

Sunscreen
Eligible
Eligible: Sunscreen is classified as an over-the-counter preventive product that protects skin from ultraviolet (UV) rays, helping to avoid sunburn and reduce the risk of skin cancer. Because it serves a clear medical preventive purpose rather than a purely cosmetic one, HSA/FSA funds can be used to purchase sunscreen without a Letter of Medical Necessity.
Note: Makeup and cosmetic products that contain SPF are generally not eligible for HSA/FSA reimbursement, as their primary purpose is considered cosmetic rather than preventive. Only standalone sunscreen products (lotions, sprays, sticks, etc.) specifically intended for sun protection are eligible.
Sunscreen for Kids
Eligible
Eligible: Sunscreen formulated for kids is fully reimbursable when it is labeled broad-spectrum and has SPF 15 or higher because it is used to prevent sunburn and long-term UV skin damage.

Supplies to treat a medical condition
Eligible
Eligible: Items categorized as “supplies to treat a medical condition” are recognized as medical care because they are used to diagnose, alleviate, or treat illnesses or injuries.

Eligible
Eligible: Support braces are medical devices intended to stabilize, protect, or relieve pain in injured or weakened joints and muscles.

Support Hose
Eligible w/LMN
Letter of Medical Necessity: Support hose can be worn simply for comfort or appearance, but they are only reimbursable when prescribed to treat a specific medical issue such as poor circulation or swelling.

Television for Hearing Impaired
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: A television, even one marketed for the hearing-impaired, is considered a general household appliance rather than a device used exclusively to treat a medical condition.

Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Veterinary fees cover medical care for pets, not for the account holder or another eligible individual, so they are classified as personal expenses rather than qualified medical care. Because pet health costs do not diagnose, treat, or prevent a medical condition for the FSA/HSA participant, they cannot be reimbursed with tax-advantaged funds.

Viagra
Eligible
Eligible: Viagra is a prescription medication specifically indicated to treat erectile dysfunction, a diagnosed medical condition, so its cost counts as a qualified medical expense. Prescription drugs are automatically eligible for HSA/FSA reimbursement when obtained with a valid prescription.

Vision Discount Programs
Not Eligible
