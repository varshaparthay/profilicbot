AA Meeting Transportation
Eligible
Eligible: Transportation costs (mileage, bus, taxi, etc.) incurred to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings are treated as part of the medical care for alcoholism, a formally recognized disease. Since AA participation is a therapeutic program for diagnosing and treating alcohol dependency, the IRS allows these travel expenses to be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds without requiring a Letter of Medical Necessity.
