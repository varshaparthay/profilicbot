Birthing Coach
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: A birthing coach (doula) offers non-medical physical and emotional support during labor and delivery, which is not automatically treated as a qualified medical service.

Light Therapy
Eligible
Eligible: Light therapy devices deliver clinically recognized therapeutic light to treat diagnosed conditions such as seasonal affective disorder, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, or depression. Because they provide a direct medical treatment rather than a general wellness or cosmetic benefit, their cost qualifies for HSA/FSA reimbursement without requiring a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Medicines, Prescription
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Prescription medicines are recognized as qualified medical expenses because they are specifically ordered by a healthcare provider to diagnose, treat, or prevent a medical condition. As long as you have the prescription (which serves as the required documentation), the cost is reimbursable with HSA/FSA funds.

Heated Neck Rest
Eligible
Eligible: Heated neck rests deliver therapeutic heat that relieves neck pain, muscle stiffness, and related discomfort. Since they are designed to treat these specific medical symptoms rather than for general comfort, they can be purchased with HSA/FSA funds without a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Pre-existing Condition
Eligible
Eligible: Medical expenses incurred to diagnose, treat, or manage a pre-existing condition are covered the same way as any other illness or injury, so they can be paid with HSA/FSA funds. Doctor visits, prescriptions, and related treatments for a condition that existed before the plan began remain qualified medical expenses.

COBRA Premiums
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: COBRA premiums are classified as insurance premium payments, and IRS rules do not allow insurance premiums to be reimbursed through an FSA. Because they are excluded expenses, they cannot be paid for or reimbursed with FSA funds under any circumstance.

Fitness Programs
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Fitness programs are ordinarily viewed as general health or wellness expenses, so they are not automatically reimbursable. They qualify only when a doctor provides a Letter of Medical Necessity stating the program is needed to treat, manage, or rehabilitate a specific diagnosed medical condition.

Pedometer
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: A pedometer is mainly a general fitness and wellness gadget that counts steps, so it is not automatically considered a qualified medical expense.

Feminine Pain Relief
Eligible
Eligible: Feminine pain relief products contain active therapeutic ingredients designed to treat menstrual cramps and related discomfort, addressing a specific medical condition.

Prescription Drugs and Medicines
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Prescription drugs and medicines are intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent specific medical conditions and therefore qualify as medical expenses. They must be accompanied by a valid prescription or appear on the pharmacy receipt with Rx details to be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds.

Detoxification
Eligible
Eligible: Detoxification refers to medically supervised treatment that removes harmful drugs, alcohol, or other toxins from the body, often provided in hospitals or rehab centers. The site lists it as a qualified form of medical care for substance abuse or poisoning, so its expenses can be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds without requiring additional documentation.

Car Rental (related to medical care)
Eligible
Eligible: Car rentals used to obtain medical care qualify because transportation expenses directly tied to medical services are considered valid medical costs. When the vehicle is rented specifically to travel to and from healthcare appointments, the expense can be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds.

Joint Supplement (Glucosamine main ingredient or glucosamine only)
Eligible
Eligible: A joint supplement made solely or primarily with glucosamine is considered an over-the-counter product used to relieve joint pain and cartilage deterioration from arthritis or related conditions. Because it is taken for a specific therapeutic purpose, it qualifies for HSA/FSA reimbursement without a prescription or Letter of Medical Necessity.

Kids Training Pants
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Kids training pants are normally considered personal hygiene items used during routine potty training, so they are not automatically covered. If a healthcare provider certifies that a child needs them to manage a diagnosed medical condition causing incontinence, a Letter of Medical Necessity makes the expense reimbursable.

Sedatives
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Sedatives are medications intended to treat conditions like insomnia or anxiety, so they qualify as a medical expense. However, IRS rules require a doctor’s prescription for any over-the-counter drug, so reimbursement is allowed only when you submit an Rx.

Television for Hearing Impaired
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: A television, even one marketed for the hearing-impaired, is considered a general household appliance rather than a device used exclusively to treat a medical condition. Because its primary function is personal entertainment and not medical care, its cost is not reimbursable with HSA/FSA funds.

Scar Treatment
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Scar treatment products are generally sold to lessen or improve the appearance of scars, so they are considered cosmetic rather than purely medical. With a doctor’s Letter of Medical Necessity stating the treatment is required to address medical issues related to a scar, the cost can be reimbursed through an HSA/FSA.

Daith Piercing
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: A daith piercing is viewed as an alternative treatment primarily for migraine relief and is not automatically recognized as a standard medical expense. To use HSA/FSA funds, you must provide a Letter of Medical Necessity from your healthcare provider explaining that the piercing is required to treat a diagnosed medical condition.

Oura Ring
Eligible
Eligible: The Oura Ring is presented as a medical-grade wearable that continuously monitors body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep metrics to help users track and manage their health conditions.

Progesterone and Testosterone Hormones
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Progesterone and testosterone are regulated prescription hormones used to treat diagnosed conditions such as menopause-related deficiencies, infertility, or low testosterone levels.

Q-tips
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Q-tips are considered general personal-hygiene items primarily used for cosmetic or routine cleaning purposes, not for diagnosing, treating, or preventing a specific medical condition. Because they serve everyday grooming needs rather than qualified medical care, HSA/FSA funds cannot be used for their purchase.

Eyewear Repair Kit
Eligible
Eligible: Eyewear repair kits are used to fix or tighten prescription glasses and sunglasses so they continue to provide medically necessary vision correction. Because they support and maintain an eligible medical device (prescription eyewear), their cost can be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds without additional documentation.

Convalescent Home
Eligible
Eligible: A convalescent home provides medically supervised nursing and rehabilitation services for people recovering from illness, injury, or surgery. Because the expense directly covers medical care in a licensed facility, the costs for that care are reimbursable with HSA/FSA funds.

Lessons
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Lessons are reimbursable only when a doctor states in a Letter of Medical Necessity that the instruction (e.g., swimming, dance, horseback riding) is required to treat or manage a specific medical condition.

Toiletries
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Toiletries such as soap, shampoo, deodorant, and similar everyday personal-care items are considered general hygiene products rather than medical treatments. Because they are purchased for routine grooming and do not diagnose, treat, or prevent a specific illness, they are not reimbursable with HSA/FSA funds under IRS rules.

Latex Gloves
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Latex gloves are classified as general-purpose personal protective items used for basic hygiene or household tasks, not for diagnosing or treating a specific medical condition. As ordinary sanitary supplies, they do not meet the criteria for HSA/FSA reimbursement.

Enema
Eligible
Eligible: An enema kit is used to relieve constipation or prepare the bowel for medical procedures, making it a device that treats a specific medical condition. Because it serves a clear therapeutic purpose rather than a general personal-care use, its cost is reimbursable with HSA/FSA funds without needing a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Blepharoplasty
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Blepharoplasty is primarily a cosmetic eyelid surgery intended to improve appearance, not to diagnose, treat, or prevent a medical condition. Because expenses for purely cosmetic procedures are excluded, this surgery cannot be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds.

Exercise Ball
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: An exercise ball is categorized as general fitness equipment aimed at overall health and physical conditioning, not the treatment of a specific medical condition. Since products intended primarily for personal fitness are excluded from qualified medical expenses, HSA/FSA funds cannot be used to purchase it.

Ileostomy Supplies
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Ileostomy supplies are specialized medical necessities that collect and manage waste for individuals who have had ileostomy surgery. Because they treat a specific medical condition and are not for general use, a prescription is required to verify their medical need before HSA/FSA funds can be used.

Hand Lotion Containing a Medicine
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Hand lotion that contains a medicinal ingredient can be used to treat diagnosed skin conditions, but it is also commonly purchased for general moisturizing or cosmetic purposes.

Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Legal fees can be reimbursed when they are directly connected to obtaining, defending, or clarifying medical care for a diagnosed condition, such as establishing guardianship or authorizing treatment.

Lumbar Support
Eligible
Eligible: Lumbar support products are classified as medical devices designed to stabilize the lower back, alleviate pain, and aid in recovery from injury or chronic conditions.

Lubricants
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Lubricants are classified as dual-purpose personal care items that are often used for general sexual comfort rather than strictly medical treatment.

As this training is considered part of medical care for pregnancy and delivery, its fees can be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds without requiring a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Pillow for Lumbar Support
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: A lumbar support pillow can help treat diagnosed conditions such as chronic back pain or sciatica by supporting proper spinal alignment, but the same pillow is also commonly bought for everyday comfort. Therefore, reimbursement requires a Letter of Medical Necessity explaining the medical condition and why this pillow is essential for the patient’s treatment.

Crowns (Dental)
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Dental crowns are recognized as a restorative treatment used to repair or replace damaged tooth structure, qualifying them as a medical expense. Reimbursement generally requires a dentist’s Letter of Medical Necessity that explains why the crown is needed to treat an illness or injury rather than for cosmetic reasons.

Blood Storage
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: The site states that blood storage costs are reimbursable only when a doctor provides a Letter of Medical Necessity explaining the blood will be used to treat or operate on the patient, spouse, or dependent within a set medical timeframe. Without this written medical justification, routine or long-term storage is not covered.

Colon Therapy, Colon Hydrotherapy, Colonics
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Colon therapy is considered an alternative treatment that may be used to address specific diagnosed digestive or elimination issues, not for general wellness or detox. Therefore, reimbursement requires a Letter of Medical Necessity from a healthcare provider stating the medical condition and need for the procedure.

Baby Formula
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Regular baby formula is treated as a general food expense that supplies routine nutrition, not as a product that diagnoses, treats, or prevents a medical condition. Because it is considered an everyday personal expense, it cannot be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds, except in the case of certain specialized formulas that would require a separate Letter of Medical Necessity.

Service Animal
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Service animals that are specially trained to help individuals with physical or mental disabilities can be reimbursed, including their purchase, training, and care costs.

Humidifier
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: A humidifier can help treat medical issues like dry sinuses, congestion, or respiratory irritation by adding moisture to the air, but it is also commonly used for general comfort. Because of this dual personal-and-medical use, FSA/HSA reimbursement requires a Letter of Medical Necessity from a healthcare provider specifying the medical condition being treated.

Eligible w/Rx: Contact lenses are prescription medical devices used to correct vision, so they qualify as a reimbursable medical expense. You must have a valid eye-care prescription (Rx) for the purchase to be eligible with HSA/FSA funds.

Medicated Shampoo
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Medicated shampoo has therapeutic ingredients formulated to treat scalp conditions like dandruff or psoriasis, so it can qualify as a medical expense.

Arch Support
Eligible
Eligible: Arch supports are classified as orthotic shoe inserts that help correct foot alignment and relieve conditions like flat feet or plantar fasciitis. Because they are designed to treat specific medical issues rather than for general comfort, they can be purchased with HSA/FSA funds without requiring a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Eligible
Eligible: Anti-snore guards are oral medical devices worn during sleep to reduce or prevent snoring, a recognized sleep-related breathing condition. Since they are used to treat a specific medical issue rather than for general comfort or cosmetic purposes, they can be purchased with HSA/FSA funds without requiring a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Eligible
Eligible: Patterning exercises are a therapeutic technique that helps individuals with brain injuries or neuromuscular disorders relearn movement patterns. Because they are used specifically to treat a diagnosed medical condition, their cost qualifies as a reimbursable medical expense under HSA/FSA rules without a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Disabled Dependent Care Expenses, Medical
Eligible
Eligible: Expenses that pay for the medical treatment, diagnosis, or nursing care of a dependent who is disabled are considered qualified medical care. Because these costs directly address the dependent’s medical condition rather than ordinary babysitting or custodial care, they can be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds.

Aromatherapy
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Aromatherapy involves using essential oils and diffusers primarily for relaxation, mood enhancement, or general wellness rather than treating a specific medical condition. Because it is considered a personal or cosmetic practice, the IRS does not view these expenses as qualified medical care, so HSA/FSA funds cannot be used for them.

Inversion Table
Eligible
Eligible: The page states that an inversion table is a therapeutic device used to relieve back pain by allowing the user to invert and decompress the spine. Because it is intended for the treatment of a specific medical condition rather than general fitness, it qualifies for HSA/FSA reimbursement without additional documentation.

Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Fluoride rinse is normally considered a general oral-care product, so it isn’t automatically covered by HSA/FSA funds. It becomes reimbursable only when a dentist issues a Letter of Medical Necessity indicating the rinse is required to treat or prevent a specific dental condition like chronic cavities or enamel weakness.

Eligible
Eligible: Glucosamine is a therapeutic supplement used to support cartilage production and relieve joint pain or osteoarthritis symptoms. Because it directly treats a medical condition, you may purchase it with HSA/FSA funds without needing further documentation.

Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Lactaid Caplets are categorized as an over-the-counter digestive aid/dietary supplement intended to ease discomfort from eating dairy, not to treat a specific medical condition.

Denture Stain Cleaner
Eligible
Eligible: Denture stain cleaners are used to remove stains and buildup from dentures—a medical device that replaces missing teeth and supports oral health. Maintenance products that clean or protect a medical device qualify as a medical expense, so these cleaners can be purchased with FSA/HSA funds.

Because they are performed for medical prevention rather than cosmetic reasons, their cost qualifies for payment or reimbursement with FSA/HSA funds without needing additional documentation.

Mobility Scooter
Eligible
Eligible: Mobility scooters are durable medical equipment intended to help people with limited ability to walk or stand due to injury, illness, or disability. Because they directly assist with a medical condition and are purchased with a doctor’s prescription, the site lists them as fully HSA/FSA eligible.

Eligible
Eligible: Investigational surgery is a bona fide medical procedure performed by licensed professionals to diagnose, treat, or manage a health condition, even while it is still under study.

Durable Medical Equipment
Eligible
Eligible: Durable medical equipment is defined as reusable devices like wheelchairs, walkers, or CPAP machines that are primarily used to treat, manage, or alleviate a medical condition.

Zinc Supplements
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Zinc supplements are categorized as general dietary supplements intended to support overall health rather than specifically diagnose, treat, or prevent a medical condition. Because vitamins and minerals taken for general wellness do not meet qualified medical expense criteria, they are not reimbursable with HSA/FSA funds.

Concierge Medicine
Eligible
Eligible: Concierge medicine involves paying a retainer to a physician for ongoing primary care services, and the amount that directly covers medical treatment qualifies as a medical expense. Because these payments are for diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of disease, they are reimbursable with HSA/FSA funds.

Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Fenugreek is an herbal dietary supplement typically taken for general wellness benefits rather than to treat a specific diagnosed illness.

Eligible w/LMN: Car modifications that adapt a vehicle for a disability (e.g., hand controls, wheelchair lifts) can qualify as medical expenses because they enable the individual to travel safely and perform daily activities.

Asthma Medicine
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Asthma medicines are over-the-counter drug products used to treat and manage the medical condition of asthma, so they qualify as a healthcare expense.

Prescription drugs and medicines obtained from other countries
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Prescription drugs purchased outside the U.S. qualify for HSA/FSA reimbursement when you have a valid prescription for them. The prescription confirms the medication is being used to treat a specific medical condition, so with this documentation the cost is treated the same as other eligible prescription drug expenses.

Erectile Dysfunction Treatment
Eligible w/Rx

Eligible: A diabetic bracelet is considered a medical identification device that alerts first responders and healthcare providers to the wearer’s diabetic condition in an emergency. Because it helps ensure proper and timely medical treatment, the cost is an eligible medical expense for HSA/FSA reimbursement.

Reimbursement requires a Letter of Medical Necessity from a healthcare provider explaining the diagnosis and how the counseling will help alleviate it.

Scooter, electric
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: An electric scooter is considered durable medical equipment that can aid individuals who have a documented mobility impairment. Because it may also be used for general convenience, the IRS requires a Letter of Medical Necessity confirming it is specifically prescribed to treat or manage a diagnosed medical condition.

Allergy Products and Treatment (Non-Drug)
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Non-drug allergy aids—such as environmental control products or other allergen-reduction items—are treated as general health conveniences unless a doctor certifies they are medically required. A Letter of Medical Necessity must state the diagnosed allergy and explain how the product will alleviate that condition for the expense to qualify.

Eligible w/Rx: Anti-parasitic drugs are used to diagnose, treat, or prevent parasitic infections, which qualifies them as medical expenses. However, the site notes that FSA/HSA reimbursement requires a prescription, so you must have an Rx to purchase these medications with tax-advantaged funds.

CPAP Hose Holder
Eligible
Eligible: A CPAP hose holder is an accessory specifically designed to elevate and stabilize the tubing used with a CPAP device for sleep apnea therapy. Since it directly supports the operation of medically necessary CPAP equipment, it is fully reimbursable with HSA/FSA funds without requiring additional documentation.

Physician Retainer Fee
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: A physician retainer fee is a prepaid membership charge that secures future or unlimited access to a doctor rather than paying for a specific medical service actually received. Because it functions like a concierge or subscription fee and does not directly cover diagnosable treatment at the time of payment, it is not an eligible medical expense for HSA/FSA reimbursement.

Genetic Testing
Eligible
Eligible: Genetic testing is recognized as a qualified diagnostic service that examines DNA to detect inherited disorders or disease risks. Because it is used by healthcare providers to diagnose or manage medical conditions, the cost of the test and related lab fees can be paid with HSA/FSA funds without a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Infant Formula
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Standard infant formula is viewed as a regular nutritional food rather than a product that treats or prevents a specific medical condition. Because it serves as everyday nourishment for healthy babies, it does not qualify for HSA/FSA reimbursement.

Anti-Embolism Socks, Stockings
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Anti-embolism socks and stockings apply medical-grade compression to help prevent blood clots and treat circulation disorders, but they resemble ordinary hosiery in everyday use. Because they are only reimbursable when prescribed for a specific diagnosed condition, a Letter of Medical Necessity is required to confirm their therapeutic purpose.

Kinesiology
Eligible
Eligible: Kinesiology services focus on assessing and improving body movement to treat or prevent injuries, chronic pain, and other physical conditions. Because they are considered a qualified form of medical care rather than general wellness, you can pay for kinesiology expenses with HSA/FSA funds without a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Half Way House
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: A half-way house provides lodging and structured care as part of drug or alcohol addiction treatment, which can be a qualified medical expense. Reimbursement requires a Letter of Medical Necessity to show the stay is doctor-prescribed and essential to the patient’s treatment plan.

Injection Snoreplasty
Eligible
Eligible: Injection snoreplasty is a physician-administered procedure that stiffens the soft palate to treat chronic snoring and related sleep issues. Because it is a direct medical treatment for a diagnosed condition, its cost is reimbursable with HSA/FSA funds.

Ear Plugs
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Ear plugs are usually viewed as personal comfort or safety items, not strictly medical devices. They can be reimbursed only when a doctor confirms they are needed to treat or prevent a diagnosed condition (e.g., chronic ear infections, noise-induced hearing loss), so a Letter of Medical Necessity is required.

Oral Remedies and Treatments
Eligible
Eligible: Oral remedies and treatments contain active medicinal ingredients formulated to treat or relieve specific oral conditions such as toothaches, canker sores, gum pain, or other mouth irritations. Since they are classified as over-the-counter drugs used to address a medical issue rather than for general cosmetic use, they are fully reimbursable with HSA/FSA funds without requiring a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Alternative Treatments
Eligible
Eligible: Alternative treatments are recognized as medical care when they are provided to diagnose, cure, mitigate, or prevent a specific illness or injury. The page notes that services such as acupuncture or other licensed non-traditional therapies fall under this category, so their costs can be paid or reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds without requiring further documentation.

Collagen Injections
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Collagen injections are generally performed for cosmetic purposes such as filling wrinkles or enhancing appearance, so they are not automatically covered. They qualify only when a doctor provides a Letter of Medical Necessity stating the treatment is required to correct or treat a specific medical condition (e.g., injury repair or reconstructive needs).

Disabled Person, expenses for
Eligible
Eligible: The page states that costs to care for a physically or mentally disabled person—such as medically required services, supplies, or home modifications—are considered qualified medical expenses. Because these items or services are used to treat, manage, or accommodate the individual’s diagnosed disability, they can be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds without additional documentation.

Egg Donor Fees
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Egg donor fees can qualify as a medical expense when they are part of a physician-directed fertility treatment plan to help diagnose or treat infertility. Because they involve third-party services and are not automatically medical care for the account holder, you must provide a Letter of Medical Necessity showing the procedure is essential for treating a specific fertility condition.

Menopause Treatment and Medical Services
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Menopause treatments are intended to diagnose, treat, and relieve the symptoms of a specific medical condition, so they qualify as medical care. However, FSA/HSA reimbursement is allowed only when you submit a prescription from a healthcare provider.

Melatonin
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Melatonin is classified as a dietary supplement that people commonly take to promote sleep, so it is not automatically considered a qualified medical expense. You can only use HSA/FSA funds for it when a doctor supplies a Letter of Medical Necessity stating it is required to treat a specific diagnosed sleep disorder or related condition.

Medicated Toothpaste
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Medicated toothpaste is classified as a general personal-hygiene product rather than a treatment for a specific medical condition. Because everyday dental-care items are excluded under IRS rules, purchases of medicated toothpaste cannot be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds.

Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Penile implants are a medical device surgically placed to treat a diagnosed condition—erectile dysfunction—so they can be reimbursed as a qualified medical expense. A Letter of Medical Necessity is required to document that the procedure is essential for the patient’s treatment.

Birthing Classes
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Birthing classes may be covered only when a physician provides a Letter of Medical Necessity stating the instruction is needed to prepare the mother for labor and delivery. Without this documentation, the classes are considered general wellness or parenting education and are not automatically reimbursable.

Handicap, Disability License Plates
Eligible
Eligible: Handicap or disability license plates are considered an adaptive aid that allows a person with a qualifying medical condition to park closer to entrances, reducing physical strain and improving mobility access. Because the plates directly help manage a disability rather than serve a general or cosmetic purpose, their cost is reimbursable with HSA/FSA funds without a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Doula
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Doula services offer non-medical labor, delivery, and postpartum support, so they aren’t automatically treated as qualified medical care. Reimbursement is allowed only when a healthcare provider issues a Letter of Medical Necessity that explains why the doula’s assistance is required for a specific pregnancy-related medical condition or treatment plan.

Stair Lift
Eligible
Eligible: A stair lift is classified as durable medical equipment that helps individuals with a medical condition or disability safely navigate stairs.

Eye Treatment Medications
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Eye treatment medications are drug products used to treat diagnosed eye conditions such as infections, allergies, dryness, or glaucoma. Since they are medicines, the IRS rules make them reimbursable only when you have a valid prescription, so they are eligible with Rx.

Eye Equipment
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Eye equipment is considered a medical device used to diagnose, protect, or correct vision, so it can be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds. However, the IRS classifies it as an over-the-counter medical supply, so you must provide a current prescription to verify it is for treating a specific vision condition.

Bonding of the teeth
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Tooth bonding is most often done for cosmetic reasons such as closing gaps, covering stains, or reshaping teeth, so it is not automatically a qualified medical expense. It becomes reimbursable only when a dentist supplies a Letter of Medical Necessity stating the procedure is needed to treat or restore a specific dental condition.

Dietary Supplements
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Dietary supplements are viewed as products taken mainly to support overall health and wellness, not to diagnose, treat, or prevent a specific medical condition. Because they are considered general‐purpose items, they do not qualify for HSA/FSA reimbursement unless a doctor specifically prescribes them, so they are classified as not eligible by default.

Sunscreen with Insect Repellant
Eligible
Eligible: Sunscreen combined with insect repellent is treated as an over-the-counter product that helps prevent sunburn and related skin conditions while also warding off insects. Broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher is recognized as a qualified, preventive medical expense, so it can be purchased with HSA/FSA funds without a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Contraceptives (Rx)
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Prescription contraceptives are accepted medical products used to prevent pregnancy, making them a qualified medical expense. They can be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds when you provide a doctor’s prescription, so eligibility is granted once the Rx requirement is met.

Massage Chair
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Massage chairs are classified as general health and wellness items intended primarily for relaxation or personal comfort, not for diagnosing, treating, or preventing a specific medical condition. Because they are considered personal-use products rather than medically necessary equipment, they cannot be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds.

Adult Day Care
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Adult day care programs mainly provide custodial supervision, social activities, and basic personal assistance for seniors or disabled adults, not medical treatment or diagnosis. Since these services are considered non-medical and primarily for daily living support, they do not qualify for HSA/FSA reimbursement.

Biotin Supplements
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: Biotin supplements are listed as general-purpose dietary vitamins aimed at supporting overall hair, skin, nail, and metabolic health rather than treating a specific medical condition. Since vitamins used for ordinary wellness are excluded from qualified medical expenses, they cannot be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds.

Chelation Therapy
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Chelation therapy removes heavy metals or toxic substances from the body, but it is not automatically treated as a standard medical expense. A Letter of Medical Necessity from a doctor is required to confirm it is prescribed to treat a specific diagnosed condition rather than for general wellness.

Goggles

Birth Control (Rx)
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Prescription birth control products (e.g., pills, patches, rings, IUDs) are considered medical treatments used to prevent pregnancy, so they qualify as an HSA/FSA expense. Because they are drugs that require a doctor’s authorization, an Rx must be on file before reimbursement is allowed.

Dandruff Shampoo
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Dandruff shampoo is primarily a personal grooming item, but it doubles as a treatment for the medical condition of dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis. Because it can serve both cosmetic and therapeutic purposes, you must submit a Letter of Medical Necessity from a healthcare provider to show it is required for medical treatment.

Mattress
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: A regular mattress is classified as household furniture meant for general comfort and does not diagnose, treat, or prevent a specific medical condition. Because it is primarily for personal use and not a dedicated medical device, its cost is not reimbursable with HSA/FSA funds.

Dehumidifier
Not Eligible
Not Eligible: A dehumidifier is viewed as a general household appliance that reduces moisture for overall comfort and benefits all occupants, not just someone with a specific medical condition. Because it is classified as a non-medical home improvement item, its cost does not qualify for HSA/FSA reimbursement.

DNA Storage
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: DNA storage can qualify when a healthcare provider certifies it is necessary to diagnose, treat, or monitor a specific medical condition.

Eyeglasses
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Prescription eyeglasses are classified as medical devices that correct refractive vision issues like nearsightedness or farsightedness. Since they must be ordered by an eye-care professional to treat a diagnosed condition, the expense is covered by HSA/FSA funds when a valid prescription is provided.

As such, their cost can be reimbursed with HSA/FSA funds without requiring a Letter of Medical Necessity.

Epinephrine
Eligible w/Rx

A Letter of Medical Necessity from a healthcare provider must detail why the animal is essential for the patient’s treatment, making the expense reimbursable only with that documentation.

Mold Removal
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Mold removal costs are reimbursable only when a doctor verifies that eliminating mold is medically necessary to treat or prevent a specific health condition, such as allergies or respiratory issues. A Letter of Medical Necessity reclassifies the service from a general home improvement to a qualified medical expense, allowing payment with HSA/FSA funds.

Coconut Oil
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Coconut oil is a multipurpose substance frequently used for cooking or general skin and hair care, so it is treated as a dual-purpose personal item. It can be reimbursed only when a doctor provides a Letter of Medical Necessity stating it is needed to treat a specific medical condition.

Diuretics
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Diuretics can treat medical issues like edema or hypertension, but they are often purchased over-the-counter and may also be used for non-medical purposes such as short-term weight loss. Therefore, the IRS requires a Letter of Medical Necessity stating the diagnosed condition and medical need before HSA/FSA funds can be used.

Rubdowns
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Rubdowns are usually considered a general wellness or relaxation service, so they do not qualify automatically.

Not Eligible

Eligible w/LMN: Lead-based paint removal is considered a home modification that only qualifies when a doctor verifies that lead exposure is endangering a specific person’s health and prescribes the remediation.

Eye Drops (Rx)
Eligible w/Rx
Eligible w/Rx: Prescription eye drops are considered a medical treatment for diagnosed eye conditions such as infection, glaucoma, or severe dryness. Because they contain regulated medications and are only dispensed with a doctor’s prescription, they qualify for HSA/FSA reimbursement when you provide the Rx.

Impotence Medicines and Treatments
Eligible w/Rx

Scale for Food or Weight
Eligible w/LMN
Eligible w/LMN: Food or weight scales are only reimbursable when a doctor verifies they are needed to monitor a specific medical condition (e.g., obesity, diabetes, kidney disease).
